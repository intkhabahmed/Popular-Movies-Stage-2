# Popular-Movies-Stage-2

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. 
In this project, youâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.</p>

<b>This app will:</b>
<ol>
<li>Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.</li>
<li>Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:</li>
<ol><li>The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated</li></ol>
<li>Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:</li>
<ol><li>original title</li>
<li>movie poster image thumbnail</li>
<li>A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)</li>
<li>user rating (called vote_average in the api)</li>
<li>release date</li>
</ol></ol>

<p>In this second and final stage, I haved added additional functionality to the app built in Stage 1.</p>

<b>Added more information to movie details view:</b>
<ol>
<li>It allows users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).</li>
<li>It allows users to read reviews of a selected movie.</li>
<li>It also allows users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).</li>
<li>Created a database to store all the details of movies to show movies in offline mode as well to show favourites.</li>
<li>Modified the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show favorites collection.</li>
<li>User can share the first trailer's youtube video link</li>
</ol>
